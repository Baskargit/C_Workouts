Round 2 ( programming test – 5 questions )

In this round, we’re expected to write code for the given problem in any of the three languages ( c, c++, java ).

Q.no.1)  Given N. print the following snake pattern (say N = 4). condition:  must not use arrays ( 1D array  or 2D array like Matrix ).

1   2   3   4

8   7   6    5

9   10  11   12

16  15  14  13

 

Q.no.2)  Given N. print the Latin Matrix (say N = 3). condition:  must not use strings(aka character literals), arrays (both 1D and 2D), inbuilt functions(like rotate).


A   B   C

B   C   A

C   A   B

Q.no.3)   Given a number N. find the minimum count of numbers in which N can be represented as a sum of numbers x1, x2, … xn. where xi is number whose digits are 0s and 1s.

example 1)  i/p :  N = 33

o/p : count = 3.     33( 11 + 11 + 11 )

some other possibilities of 33 is (11 + 11 + 10 + 1),   (11 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 ), (10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1)

Q.no.4)   Finding all permutations of a string. ( backtracking approach ).

Q.no.5)   Given an array of integers, write a program to re-arrange the array in the given form.

1st_largest, 1st_smallest, 2nd_largest, 2nd_smallest, 3rd_largest ……. etc.
