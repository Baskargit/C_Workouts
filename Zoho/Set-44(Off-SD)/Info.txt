Zoho Interview Experience for Software Developer
Round 1: 
30 apti questions out  of which 15 logical apti and 15 technical c apti. Logical  C apti very basic and most of them will make you think logical to get the answer, instead of using some xyz formula stuff. And for C apti  2 -3 pointer, 4 array, 4 find output for given snippet assuming the above code execute properly, 4-5 recursive based questions where asked.

Round 2: 
In this round 5 questions given at one after one. We are supposed to tell the logic for the question and they may ask to reiterate if the logic is not that good. You have to code in the ide and have to clear all the edge cases.

Convert integer to binary (using recursive).
Reverse the string without disturbing the vowels and space.
Get the repeated numbers in the array
On problem related to merge sort.
On problem related to linked list where asked.
50 attended out of which 13 stepped for next round



Round 3:

After stations are added in middle like B, C, D, E. Where people can board any station and get down at any station assuming train is going from A to F.
