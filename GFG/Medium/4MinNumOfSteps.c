Given a number line from -infinity to +infinity. You start at 0 and can go either to the left or to the right. The condition is that in iâ€™th move, you take i steps. You are given a Destination , you have to print the minimum number of steps required to reach that destination.

Input:
2
10

Output:
3
4

Explanation:

In the first test case we can go from 0 to 1 (1 step) and then from 1 to -1 (2 steps) and then from -1 to 2 (3 steps). So in 3 steps we have reached our destination by taking i steps in ith turn.

#include<stdio.h>

int minimumsteps(int dest,int currentValue,int i);

int main()
{
    int dest = 14;

    printf("%d\n",minimumsteps(dest,0,1));
    return 0;
}

int minimumsteps(int dest,int currentValue,int i)
{
    printf("%d\n",currentValue);
    if (currentValue + i == dest)
    {
        return i;
    }
    
    return minimumsteps(dest,(currentValue + i < dest) ? currentValue + i : currentValue - i,i+1);
}
